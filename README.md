## Overview

I took on the challenge the build the meet landing page for mobile, tablet and desktop. In building this project I decided to bulid the website mobile-first rather then desktop-first.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
